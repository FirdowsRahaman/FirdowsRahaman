# 👋 Hi, I'm Firdows!

I build at the intersection of **AI, software engineering, and cloud infrastructure**, creating practical, high-impact systems powered by LLMs, agentic workflows, and modern ML. My work spans **computer vision, NLP, multimodal reasoning, and neuroimaging**, with a strong focus on reliability, scalability, and real-world applicability.

I enjoy architecting robust ML platforms on **AWS, GCP, and Bedrock**, designing systems that are cloud-native, efficient, and production-ready. Much of my work combines **RAG**, **MCP-driven agents**, **ADK-based tool use**, and **end-to-end MLOps** to support applications in healthcare, cybersecurity, and enterprise automation.

I’m especially interested in **clinical and healthcare AI**—including MRI analytics, CXR pipelines, and IVF-related deep learning—as well as the engineering challenges behind **autonomous agents, orchestration, and dependable large-scale AI systems**.
